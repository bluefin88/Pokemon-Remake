==============

Noob javascript practice - Learn by Coding

Basically a recreation of the fight sequence in  a classical gameboy Pokemon game.

TO-DO

1. Get a functioning fight sequence. With 2 preset pokemon objects. Turn base fight untill one's health depletes.
2. Add a selection of attack. Computer opponent select random attack.
3. Complete introduction.
4. Write Pokemon encounter - give choice of running or fighting.
5. Add more pokemon objects and make pokemon type encounter random.
6. Tweak fight sequence so that attack value are sligtly randomized. i.e. Base attack 30 * random value, or critical hits
7. Add option to capture pokemon if health is <= 10%


LONG TERM AND HIGHLY OPTIMISTIC GOAL

Somehow integrate it into a browser so that it is no longer text based but have an interface and graphics.
Would need HTML5, CSS3, Processing knowledge as well.
